This report and code present the design and simulation of a 32-bit Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL and the ModelSim digital simulation tool. The project includes detailed steps for installing ModelSim, creating the simulation project, and implementing the ALU to support arithmetic and logic operations from the CS147DV instruction set, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, shifts, and bitwise functions. The ALU module was fully tested using a Verilog testbench that verified functionality across all operations and displayed signal waveforms for validation. Both the report and code demonstrate how the ALU was designed, tested, and simulated to confirm its correctness and reliability. The project concludes with successful verification of all operations and a discussion of the ALU’s importance as a core component of digital systems.
